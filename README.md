# VLRC Final

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and optimized with **Turbopack** for ultra-fast development.

## Features

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Turbopack** for lightning-fast bundling
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Source files** organized in `src/` directory

## Getting Started

First, run the development server with Turbopack:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server with Turbopack enabled for faster builds and hot reloading.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file with Turbopack's optimized hot reloading.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
